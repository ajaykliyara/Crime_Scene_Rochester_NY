    "3. Use historical data to Predict the probability of crime using SKLearn at a given location, month of the year and time of day. This section involved building a predictive model to help predict possibility of crime at a given location and time.\n",
    "4. Supplement prediction with density of specific crimes at the location. This section involved visualizing the hotspots in the data by crime time. The idea was to supplement the prediction result to help the user make their decision.\n",
    "5. Build an application on top the predictive model to present the user with a user interface to consume the data. Tabpy integration with Tableau was used for this purpose."

More violent crimes like murder was at the lower end of the spectrum. It also helped determine key features that could help in predicting crime such as location, time of year and day. \n",
    "KNN Classifier was able to achieve a relatively good accuracy of 87% after balancing the dataset. It was able to predict probability of various crime types given a location, time of day and month of the year. \n",
